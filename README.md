# Boilerplate Next.js With AntD

This example shows how to use Next.js along with [Ant Design of React](http://ant.design). This is intended to show the integration of this UI toolkit with the Framework.

## How to use
#### Dont forget to copy next-env.example.js to next-env.js :)

Install it and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn
yarn dev
